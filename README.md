## why

"The principal factor believed to be retarding growth and recovery of the [NARW] population is entanglement with fishing gear" - [NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-NE-258](noaa_20611_DS1.pdf)

"There are two endangered populations at stake here: the North Atlantic right whale and the Maine lobster fishermen.” - [The Lobster Trap](https://apps.bostonglobe.com/metro/2021/12/the-lobster-trap/?p1=Article_Inline_Related_Link)

[The lobster industry in Maine has doubled since 2000](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/commercial-fishing/landings/documents/lobster.graph.2021.pdf)

[Since 2010, the average number of new NARW calves per year has halved, from 23 to 12](https://www.int-res.com/articles/feature/d143p205.pdf)

Due to warming waters in [Gulf of Maine, lobster fishing](https://lobsterfrommaine.com/protecting-our-oceans-and-coasts/) has moved farther North and off-shore, ropes got stronger

[A Risk Analysis of Entanglement](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/efb2e1d058054fb6a1487d964397bffd)

["Unusual Mortality Event"](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-life-distress/2017-2022-north-atlantic-right-whale-unusual-mortality-event):
"a stranding that is unexpected, involves a significant die-off of any marine mammal population, and demands
immediate response"

Closures around Cape Code since 2015
Closures in Maine since 2021

### and how [gory](https://github.com/robibok/whales) [details](https://blog.deepsense.ai/deep-learning-right-whale-recognition-kaggle/)

* ROVs - [acoustic detection of whales](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/10.0005898)
* season limits -
* speed limits - slow down when right whales are seen
  * "voluntary cooperation with DMAs has not proven to have a meaningful impact on vessel speed reduction"
* traps/trawl - less vertical lines
* weak rope and ropeless aka on-call fishing gear
  * [weak rope - breaks](https://www.mass.gov/doc/12422-dmf-offering-free-buoy-line-marking-materials-and-additional-free-weak-rope/download)
  * [early ropeless technology](https://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/feature/whale-safe-fishing-gear/)
  * [ongoing technology testing](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/ropeless-fishing-gear-feasibility-study)

   * ropeless gear should also include locator tech, so anyone (trawlers) can know where there are traps without buoys 
 * gill nets - acoustic signals to warn whales
 * [2021 proposed regulation changes](https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/2021-01/TRTFactSheetRev011221.pdf) related to [ALWTR](https://fisheries.noaa.gov/ALWTRP)
   * around 2/3 of entanglements are occuring in Gulf 0f Main and Canada
